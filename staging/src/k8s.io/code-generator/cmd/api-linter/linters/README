# API linter

The API linter follows the same rules as openapi-gen, and validates API conventions on every type or package
that requires API definition generation. The following rules are the same from openapi-gen:

- To generate definition for a specific type or package add "+k8s:openapi-gen=true" tag to the type/package comment lines.
- To exclude a type or a member from a tagged package/type, add "+k8s:openapi-gen=false" tag to the comment lines.
